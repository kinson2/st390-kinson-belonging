This repo is primarily for writing and coding on belonging and ontological narratives of UG students in the statistics discipline.

Undergraduate students who are underrepresented in the statistics discipline are encouraged to explore their own feelings of belonging in the discipline and meanings related to identity.

## Initial Questions

Here are some initial questions we should answer.

1. When was the first time you felt like you belonged in the statistics major/program/discipline?

2. What did that feel like?

3. Did something specific occur that gave you that feeling of belonging? Describe that occurrence.

4. Are there things/moments/incidents that have happened while being in the statistics discipline that made you not want to remain in the discipline? Describe the thing.

5. How long do you see yourself being/working in the statistics discipline?

6. How confident are you in programming/coding?

7. How confident are you at data analysis?

9. How confident are you at collaborating with classmates you do not know?

10. How confident are you at presenting information written and/or in person?
